Using the Program:
To run the code, you must run the Master Script.

This Can be done in linux by opening a terminal in the location of the project and
typing "./MasterScript.sh" before pressing enter.

(You might need to chmod the scripts in order to have them run. This can be done for each script by typing
"Chmod 777 ScriptName.sh" into the terminal for each script, using the filename in place of "ScriptName")

To use the --grade flag, simply run "./MasterScript.sh --grade" and you will recieve a text file listing all the randomly created IPs.
